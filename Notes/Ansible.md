### **Ansible Commonly Used Commands: Detailed Explanation with Use Cases and Examples**

Ansible provides a variety of commands to manage and automate infrastructure. Understanding how to effectively use these commands is crucial for automation, troubleshooting, and performing tasks efficiently. Below is a detailed breakdown of the most commonly used Ansible commands, along with their use cases and examples.

---

### 1. **`ansible`** – Run ad-hoc commands

The `ansible` command is used to run **ad-hoc** commands on remote systems. An ad-hoc command is a one-off task that is executed on the specified hosts without the need for a playbook.

#### **Use Case**:
- Running simple tasks like gathering facts, checking if a service is running, or installing a package.
- It’s a great way to test or manage remote hosts without writing full playbooks.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible <host-pattern> -m <module> -a "<arguments>"
```

#### **Example 1**: **Ping a host** using the `ping` module.
```bash
ansible all -m ping
```
- This will run the `ping` module on all hosts defined in the inventory. It returns a success message if the host is reachable.

#### **Example 2**: **Install a package** using the `apt` module (for Debian-based systems).
```bash
ansible webservers -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present"
```
- This command installs the `nginx` package on the `webservers` group of hosts. The `state=present` ensures the package is installed.

#### **Example 3**: **Check disk usage** using the `command` module.
```bash
ansible all -m command -a "df -h"
```
- This runs the `df -h` command on all hosts to show disk usage.

### 2. **`ansible-playbook`** – Run Ansible Playbooks

The `ansible-playbook` command is used to run Ansible playbooks. Playbooks define tasks in a structured, repeatable manner, allowing for complex automation workflows.

#### **Use Case**:
- Execute playbooks that define multiple tasks, roles, and configurations on target hosts.
- Ideal for long-running tasks or when multiple operations are required across many hosts.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-playbook <playbook.yml> [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **Run a simple playbook**.
```bash
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
```
- This runs the playbook `deploy.yml` on the hosts specified in the playbook’s inventory or `ansible.cfg`.

#### **Example 2**: **Run a playbook with extra variables**.
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -e "env=production"
```
- This passes the extra variable `env=production` to the playbook, allowing dynamic configuration based on the environment.

#### **Example 3**: **Run a playbook with limit** (only specific hosts).
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --limit webservers
```
- This limits the execution of the playbook to the `webservers` group, skipping other hosts in the inventory.

#### **Example 4**: **Check playbook syntax** (dry-run).
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
```
- This simulates the execution of the playbook, allowing you to check for errors without making any changes to the target systems.

### 3. **`ansible-galaxy`** – Manage Ansible Roles

The `ansible-galaxy` command is used to interact with Ansible’s role repository, called **Galaxy**. Roles are reusable and shareable units of automation, and `ansible-galaxy` helps you manage and share them.

#### **Use Case**:
- Installing, creating, or managing roles from the Ansible Galaxy repository or local system.
- Ideal for extending Ansible’s functionality by leveraging community-contributed roles.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-galaxy <subcommand> [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **Install a role from Ansible Galaxy**.
```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
```
- This installs the `apache` role from the `geerlingguy` collection on Ansible Galaxy.

#### **Example 2**: **Create a new role**.
```bash
ansible-galaxy init my_role
```
- This initializes a new role named `my_role` in the current directory.

#### **Example 3**: **Search for a role on Galaxy**.
```bash
ansible-galaxy search apache
```
- This searches the Ansible Galaxy repository for roles related to Apache.

### 4. **`ansible-inventory`** – Manage Inventory Files

The `ansible-inventory` command is used to display and manage Ansible inventory files. Inventory files define the hosts and groups of hosts that Ansible manages.

#### **Use Case**:
- Display or manipulate inventory data (static or dynamic).
- View host variables or groupings defined in the inventory file.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-inventory [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **Display inventory**.
```bash
ansible-inventory --list
```
- This command prints the entire inventory in JSON format, showing all hosts and groups, as well as any associated variables.

#### **Example 2**: **Display a specific group in the inventory**.
```bash
ansible-inventory --host webservers
```
- This command shows the details (like variables) for the `webservers` group.

#### **Example 3**: **Generate inventory from a dynamic source**.
```bash
ansible-inventory -i aws_ec2.yaml --list
```
- This command runs a dynamic inventory from the `aws_ec2.yaml` configuration, which can query an AWS account to get live host information.

---

### 5. **`ansible-config`** – Manage Ansible Configuration

The `ansible-config` command is used to view and validate Ansible configuration files (`ansible.cfg`). It can be used to print settings, check for issues, and modify the configuration.

#### **Use Case**:
- View or troubleshoot the `ansible.cfg` configuration file.
- Validate the correctness of configuration settings.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-config [subcommand] [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **View current configuration settings**.
```bash
ansible-config list
```
- This command lists the current configuration options set in `ansible.cfg`.

#### **Example 2**: **Check the configuration file for errors**.
```bash
ansible-config validate
```
- This validates the `ansible.cfg` file and checks for errors in configuration.

#### **Example 3**: **View the default configuration**.
```bash
ansible-config dump
```
- This command shows the default settings for all configuration options.

### 6. **`ansible-pull`** – Pull Configuration from a Git Repository

The `ansible-pull` command allows you to run Ansible playbooks directly from a Git repository. This is particularly useful for configuring nodes in a decentralized way, where each machine pulls its own configuration from a version-controlled source.

#### **Use Case**:
- Automatically pull playbooks from a Git repository and apply configuration to the local machine.
- Ideal for scenarios where multiple nodes need to pull configurations independently.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-pull -U <repository-url> [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **Run a playbook from a Git repository**.
```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/username/playbooks.git
```
- This pulls the playbook from the given Git repository and runs it on the local system.

#### **Example 2**: **Run with extra variables**.
```bash
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/username/playbooks.git -e "env=production"
```
- This runs the playbook with the extra variable `env=production`.

### 7. **`ansible-vault`** – Encrypt Sensitive Data

The `ansible-vault` command is used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets. It can be used to securely store secrets in Ansible.

#### **Use Case**:
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, secrets) to store it safely within playbooks.
- Decrypt encrypted files when needed for use in tasks.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-vault <subcommand> [options]
```

#### **Example 1**: **Encrypt a file**.
```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```
- This command encrypts the `secrets.yml` file using AES encryption.

#### **Example 2**: **Decrypt a file**.
```bash
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
```
- This command decrypts the `secrets.yml` file.

#### **Example 3**: **Edit an encrypted file**.
```bash
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
```
- This opens the encrypted file in an editor (e.g., `vim`) and prompts for a password to decrypt it.

### 8. **`ansible-doc`** – View Documentation for Modules

The `ansible-doc` command allows you to view the documentation for any Ansible module. It provides detailed information on the usage, parameters, and examples for Ansible modules.

#### **Use Case

**:
- Quickly find documentation for any module you wish to use in your playbooks or ad-hoc commands.

#### **Syntax**:
```bash
ansible-doc <module-name>
```

#### **Example 1**: **View documentation for the `apt` module**.
```bash
ansible-doc apt
```
- This displays the documentation for the `apt` module, including details on all parameters and examples of usage.

#### **Example 2**: **View documentation for all modules**.
```bash
ansible-doc -l
```
- This lists all available modules.
